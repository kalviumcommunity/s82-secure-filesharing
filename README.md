# Secure File Sharing 

## Project Overview

The Secure File Sharing System is a web-based platform designed to ensure secure file uploads, sharing, and management. The system leverages robust encryption techniques and access controls to protect files from unauthorized access. By implementing cutting-edge security practices, this project aims to provide users with a reliable and efficient platform for safeguarding sensitive data during file transfers and storage.

## Project Goal

To create a user-friendly, secure platform for file sharing that ensures data privacy and integrity by incorporating encryption, access control mechanisms, and monitoring features.

## Core Features

### 1. User Authentication & Authorization
- Implement secure login and signup.
- Add features like **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for additional security.
- Role-based access (e.g., admin vs. regular users).

### 2. File Upload & Storage
- Allow users to upload files (with size and type restrictions).
- Encrypt files before saving them to the server or cloud storage.
- Use storage services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or local file storage.

### 3. Secure File Sharing
- Generate unique, expiring links for file sharing.
- Allow users to set permissions (e.g., "view-only," "download," or "edit").
- Optionally add password protection for shared links.

### 4. File Encryption
- Encrypt files at rest using **AES-256 encryption**.
- Ensure files are decrypted only when authorized users access them.

### 5. Activity Logs
- Maintain logs of who accessed/downloaded shared files.
- Notify users of unusual activities (e.g., multiple failed login attempts).

### 6. Responsive Design
- Make the system accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Optional Features (For Advanced Functionality)
1. **Real-Time Notifications**  
   - Notify users about file access or download.
   - Send alerts for file expiration warnings.

2. **Search and Filters**  
   - Enable users to search for files by name, type, or tags.
   - Filter files by upload date or shared status.

3. **File Preview**  
   - Allow users to preview certain file types (e.g., PDFs, images) in the browser.

4. **Data Backup**  
   - Implement automatic file backups for disaster recovery.

## High-Level Architecture

### Frontend:
- **Framework**: React.js, Next.js, or Vue.js.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS.
- **Features**: User interface for file uploads, sharing, and management.

### Backend:
- **Framework**: Node.js (Express) or Python (Flask/Django).
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handle API requests.
  - Encrypt/decrypt files.
  - Manage database operations (user data, file metadata).

### Database:
- **Relational DB**: PostgreSQL or MySQL (for user/file metadata).
- **NoSQL DB**: MongoDB (if more flexibility is needed).

### Storage:
- Local storage (development phase) or cloud-based storage like:
  - **AWS S3**: Secure, scalable file storage.
  - **Google Cloud Storage** or **Azure Blob Storage**.

### Security:
- Use HTTPS for secure communication.
- Secure file storage with encryption at rest and in transit.
- Implement access tokens (JWT) for authentication.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (with Tailwind CSS for styling).
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js or Python Flask/Django.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for user and file metadata).
- **Storage**: AWS S3 (for encrypted file storage).
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth or custom JWT-based system.

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication & Authorization**:
   - Secure login/signup with password hashing (bcrypt).
   - Multi-factor authentication (e.g., OTP via email/SMS or authenticator apps).
   - Role-based access (e.g., admin vs. regular users).

2. **File Upload & Storage**:
   - Support for uploading files with size/type restrictions.
   - Encryption of files before storage (e.g., AES-256 encryption).
   - Cloud storage integration (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud).

3. **Secure File Sharing**:
   - Generate expiring, unique links for shared files.
   - Set sharing permissions (view-only, download, edit).
   - Password-protected links for enhanced security.

4. **Encryption**:
   - Files encrypted at rest before being stored on the server/cloud.
   - End-to-end encryption for file transfers (HTTPS).

5. **File Management**:
   - User dashboard to view, organize, and search files.
   - Filters and tags for easier file navigation.

6. **Activity Logs**:
   - Detailed logs of file access and downloads.
   - Alerts for suspicious activities (e.g., multiple failed logins).

7. **File Expiry and Auto-Deletion**:
   - Expiring links to ensure temporary access.
   - Automatic file deletion after a predefined period.

## Why This Project?

I am deeply interested in security and the growing need to protect sensitive data in todayâ€™s digital age. With the increasing number of data breaches and unauthorized file accesses, I want to build a solution that emphasizes secure file handling and sharing.  

This project will help me enhance my skills in encryption, authentication, and full-stack development, while also addressing a real-world problem. By working on this project, I aim to gain practical experience in implementing security best practices and delivering a user-friendly yet highly secure web application.
