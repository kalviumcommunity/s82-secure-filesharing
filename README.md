# Secure File Sharing System

## Project Overview

The **Secure File Sharing System** is a web-based platform designed to ensure secure file uploads, sharing, and management. The system leverages robust encryption techniques and access controls to protect files from unauthorized access. By implementing cutting-edge security practices, this project aims to provide users with a reliable and efficient platform for safeguarding sensitive data during file transfers and storage.

## Project Goal

To create a user-friendly, secure platform for file sharing that ensures **data privacy and integrity** by incorporating encryption, access control mechanisms, and monitoring features.

## Core Features

### User Authentication & Authorization
- Implement secure login and signup.
- Add features like **multi-factor authentication (MFA)** for additional security.
- Role-based access (e.g., admin vs. regular users).

### File Upload & Storage
- Allow users to upload files (with size and type restrictions).
- **Encrypt files** before saving them to the server or cloud storage.
- Use storage services like **AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or local file storage**.

### Secure File Sharing
- Generate **unique, expiring links** for file sharing.
- Allow users to set **permissions** (e.g., "view-only," "download," or "edit").
- Optionally add **password protection** for shared links.

### File Encryption
- Encrypt files at rest using **AES-256 encryption**.
- Ensure files are **decrypted only when authorized users** access them.

### Activity Logs
- Maintain logs of **who accessed/downloaded** shared files.
- Notify users of **unusual activities** (e.g., multiple failed login attempts).

### Responsive Design
- Make the system accessible on both **desktop and mobile devices**.

## Optional Features (for Advanced Functionality)

### Real-Time Notifications
Notify users about:
- **File access** or download.
- **File expiration warnings**.

### Search and Filters
- Enable users to **search for files** by name, type, or tags.
- Filter files by **upload date** or **shared status**.

### File Preview
- Allow users to **preview** certain file types (e.g., PDFs, images) in the browser.

### Data Backup
- Implement **automatic file backups** for disaster recovery.

## High-Level Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React.js, Next.js, or Vue.js.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS.
- **Features**: User interface for file uploads, sharing, and management.

### Backend
- **Framework**: Node.js (Express) or Python (Flask/Django).
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Handle API requests.
  - Encrypt/decrypt files.
  - Manage database operations (user data, file metadata).

### Database
- **Relational DB**: PostgreSQL or MySQL (for user/file metadata).
- **NoSQL DB**: MongoDB (if more flexibility is needed).

### Storage
- Local storage (development phase) or cloud-based storage like:
  - **AWS S3**: Secure, scalable file storage.
  - **Google Cloud Storage** or **Azure Blob Storage**.

### Security
- Use **HTTPS** for secure communication.
- Secure file storage with **encryption at rest and in transit**.
- Implement **access tokens (JWT)** for authentication.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js (with Tailwind CSS for styling).
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js or Python Flask/Django.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for user and file metadata).
- **Storage**: AWS S3 (for encrypted file storage).
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth or custom JWT-based system.

## Key Features

### User Authentication & Authorization
- Secure login/signup with **password hashing (bcrypt)**.
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** (e.g., OTP via email/SMS or authenticator apps).
- **Role-based access** (e.g., admin vs. regular users).

### File Upload & Storage
- Support for **uploading files** with size/type restrictions.
- **Encryption of files** before storage (e.g., AES-256 encryption).
- **Cloud storage integration** (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud).

### Secure File Sharing
- Generate **expiring, unique links** for shared files.
- Set **sharing permissions** (view-only, download, edit).
- **Password-protected links** for enhanced security.

### Encryption
- Files **encrypted at rest** before being stored on the server/cloud.
- **End-to-end encryption** for file transfers (**HTTPS**).

### File Management
- **User dashboard** to view, organize, and search files.
- **Filters and tags** for easier file navigation.

### Activity Logs
- **Detailed logs** of file access and downloads.
- **Alerts** for suspicious activities (e.g., multiple failed logins).

### File Expiry and Auto-Deletion
- **Expiring links** to ensure temporary access.
- **Automatic file deletion** after a predefined period.

## Why This Project?

I am deeply interested in **security** and the growing need to **protect sensitive data** in today‚Äôs digital age. With the increasing number of **data breaches and unauthorized file accesses**, I want to build a solution that emphasizes **secure file handling and sharing**.

This project will help me **enhance my skills** in encryption, authentication, and full-stack development, while also addressing a **real-world problem**. By working on this project, I aim to **gain practical experience** in implementing **security best practices** and delivering a **user-friendly yet highly secure web application**.
